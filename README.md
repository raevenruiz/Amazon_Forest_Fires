# Amazon_Forest_Fires

The purpose of this report is to showcase my understanding of several Python libraries, as well as my ability to use Jupyter Notebook to 
illustrate and communicate my findings. The dataset this report revolved around came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gustavomodelli/forest-fires-in-brazil).

The Python libraries I used for this report are:
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Pylplot (from Matplotlib)

Questions and Suggestions are always welcomed: raeven.ruiz98@gmail.com
